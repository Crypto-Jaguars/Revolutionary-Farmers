# 🤖 ElizaOS Setup Guide - Let's Build Something Amazing! 🚀

Welcome to this friendly guide on setting up ElizaOS! We'll walk through everything step by step to get your AI agent up and running. Let's make this journey fun and straightforward! 

## 📋 Before We Begin

Make sure you have these tools ready:
* Node.js 23 or newer (nvm recommend 🎯)
* pnpm 9 or newer

## 🌟 Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Getting Started 🎬
First, let's grab the ElizaOS code:
* Clone the ElizaOS repository to your local machine
* Head over to their awesome quickstart guide at elizaos.github.io/eliza/docs/quickstart
* Follow those instructions - they're super helpful! 

### 2. Configuration Magic ✨
Now for the fun part - setting up your agent:
* Find the JSON file in the designated folder
* Copy that JSON goodness into the characters section
* Add 'twitter' to your client configuration
* Set up Google as your model (Gemini is amazing!)

### 3. API Keys & Credentials 🔑
Let's get those keys sorted:
* Visit the Google Gemini page to get your API key (Don't worry, it's free!)
* Create your `.env` file
* Add your Twitter credentials
* Pop in that Gemini API key

### 4. Launch Time 🚀
Almost there! Open two terminals:

In terminal 1:
```bash
pnpm start --character="characters/revobot.character.json"
```

In terminal 2:
```bash
pnpm start:client
```

## 🔄 Alternative Paths

Want to mix things up? No problem! 

### Different Clients 🌐
* Skip the client altogether and use the web interface
* Choose another client that suits your needs better
* The world is your oyster! 

### Alternative Models 🧠
* Try OpenRouter - it's free and fantastic!
* When switching models:
  * Update the agent configuration
  * Add the corresponding API key to your `.env` file
  * Make sure everything matches up
