# Introduction:
Stablecoins are a core part of decentralized finance (DeFi) as they allow users to enjoy the benefits of crypto as a payment option with a much-reduced volatility risk. 

Predictions show that stablecoins will gain even more relevance in 2025, as crypto continues to go mainstream. A report from Galaxy Digital shows total stablecoin supply will double to exceed [$400 billion](https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/crypto-predictions-2025/), driven by their increasing adoption in payments, remittances, and settlements. 

For those with limited banking access and who want to be beyond government control, stablecoins are a necessity. 

However, popular stablecoins like Tether USD (USDT), Circle USD (USDC), and DAI (DAI) are pegged to the US Dollar, still leaving a gap for stablecoins pegged to local currencies. These stablecoins are better because they:

- allow for easy payments within a country, as merchants can price goods in stablecoins pegged to their local currency, [ensuring consistent valuation](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/article/what-are-stablecoins-how-to-use-them/).
- local stores do not have to convert this stablecoin to spendable local currency.

The stablecoin in this research will be pegged 1:1 to the Costa Rican Colón (CRC), making it easier for anyone to make payments and transfer money in Costa Rica without going through traditional finance channels.

Also, this stablecoin must be able to  handle high transaction volumes quickly and efficiently, as adoption grows.

# Stablecoin Design: 
## Network Technicalities:
The stablecoin will be issued on the [Stellar Network](https://stellar.org/), leveraging its low-cost transactions, fast settlement times [3-5 seconds](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/stellar-blockchain-payments-xlm-coin), and native multi-currency support.

To create a stable and trustworthy CRC-pegged asset on the Stellar network, these key steps should be followed:

**1. Asset Documentation and Transparency**
Proper asset documentation through stellar.toml files is crucial. This documentation must include:

- Comprehensive asset identification information
- Clear redemption instructions
- Detailed KYC/AML requirements
- Accessible contact information
- Explicit terms of service 
This transparency and [documentation](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tokens/publishing-asset-info) not only fulfill regulatory requirements but also build trust with users and partners in the ecosystem.

**2. Anchor Services and Partnership:**
A regulated financial institution is recommended to handle CRC deposits and withdrawals. The technical implementation follows several Stellar Ecosystem Proposals (SEPs), particularly [SEP-24](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0024.md) for interactive deposit/withdrawal interfaces, SEP-1 for proper asset metadata documentation, and [SEP-6](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0006.md) for deposit/withdrawal APIs. 

**3. Regulatory compliance:**
For regulatory compliance, the implementation can leverage [Stellar's native clawback functionality](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/encyclopedia/transactions-specialized/clawbacks), which must be enabled at asset creation through the AUTH_CLAWBACK_ENABLED flag. This feature provides essential regulatory tools for addressing potential fraud cases and maintaining compliance with Costa Rican financial regulations.

**4. Technical Implementation and Monitoring:**
Stellar Ecosystem Proposals (SEPs) for technical implementation and maintains continuous oversight of:

- Peg stability
- Liquidity pool health
- Network performance
- Automated compliance checks
- Transaction reporting systems
- Suspicious activity monitoring 
- Oracle networks 

**5. Protocol Changes:**
To allow for future updates to the stablecoin's operation, a governance model is necessary. This may involve voting by stablecoin holders, allowing them to agree on changes to collateral types and reserve management policies.

## Security Measures:
To ensure the stability and security of the stablecoin, a separation of accounts is recommended.

Two separate accounts will be used to manage the stablecoin:

**An Issuing Account:** [Held in cold storage](https://www.leewayhertz.com/set-up-deposits-withdrawals-stellar/), this account should have multi-signature requirements [(3-5 signers)](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/encyclopedia/security/signatures-multisig) to prevent unauthorized access. Its sole purpose will be to sign transactions for creating new tokens.

**A Distribution Account:** [This account](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tokens/how-to-issue-an-asset) will handle all day-to-day operations, including processing transactions, managing market-making operations, and interacting with anchors.

By separating the issuing and distribution accounts, the issuer can:

- Prevent unlimited token creation in case the distribution account is compromised
- Ensure that the issuing account, which holds the authority to create new tokens, remains secure and inaccessible to unauthorized parties

This design ensures the stability and [security of the stablecoin](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tokens/control-asset-access), while also providing a scalable and efficient solution for transactions.

## Pegging:
This stablecoin will be pegged to the Costa Rican Colón (CRC), a currency that is not as stable as the US dollar. To manage potential fluctuations, a dynamic peg is recommended. This mechanism will enable the issuer to adjust the peg rate dynamically, providing [controlled flexibility](https://www.shiftmarkets.com/blog/how-do-stablecoins-maintain-their-peg) in extreme market conditions.
The maintenance of the CRC peg relies heavily on Stellar's built-in decentralized exchange [(SDEX)](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/encyclopedia/sdex/liquidity-on-stellar-sdex-liquidity-pools)

This involves establishing primary market pairs between the CRC-stablecoin and XLM, as well as secondary pairs with other stable assets available on the Stellar network, such as USDC. The peg stability requires [dedicated market makers](https://stellar.org/blog/developers/liquidity-liquidity-liquidity) implement spread management strategies and maintain adequate liquidity pools. The system can utilize Stellar's passive offers feature to maintain tight spreads, while implementing circuit breakers for periods of high volatility.

## Collateralized Model:
In respect to the collateralization ratio, the stablecoin would be 1:1 backed by reserves (meaning for every stablecoin issued, there is an equal amount of value held in the reserve). This ratio is crucial in ensuring that the peg remains intact.

Among the three collateralized models (full, partial, and algorithmic), a fully collateralized model is the safest approach to ensure [the stablecoin's stability](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stablecoin.asp). Although it is resource-intensive, this model will build trust among users, who can confidently convert their stablecoins to cash. 
Regulators will also find this model [easier to understand](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law/resources/business-law-today/2024-september/state-stablecoin-regulation-emergence-global-principles/), as reserves are tangible and auditable. However, maintaining 100% CRC reserves can be expensive and limits scalability.

The algorithmic model, although more dynamic and less capital-intensive, may not gain user trust due to the collapse of Terra/LUNA's [stablecoin](https://blockapps.net/blog/understanding-the-collapse-of-terrausd-ust-lessons-and-implications-for-stablecoins-in-cryptocurrency/), TerraUSD (UST) in 2022, which lost its peg and caused significant market turmoil. This crash has led to diminished user trust in such models.

The partially collateralized model is another option, offering reduced capital intensity and dependence on CRC. This model is ideal if the issuer wants to back the stablecoin with a mix of CRC and USDC. However, due to CRC's instability, this model is more complex to set up. Also, problems with USDC will directly impact the coin.

The stablecoin might be over-collateralized to provide extra security or under-collateralized for higher efficiency, depending on how much risk the issuer is willing to take.

## Reserve Management System:
An excellent reserve management is critical for maintaining the stablecoin's peg, particularly during periods of market stress or currency volatility. Effective management must ensure sufficient reserves, liquidity, and accessibility for redemptions at all times. This also provides a transparent way to demonstrate to regulators that the issuer holds actual assets backing the stablecoin.

CRC holdings must be liquid and held in easily accessible accounts, such as commercial banks or central bank integrations. An emergency pool should also be established to address crisis situations or unmatched demand.

Integrating a Proof-of-Reserve (POR) infrastructure into the management system is advisable, to [build trust](https://blog.chain.link/stablecoins-and-proof-of-reserve/) with users and regulators. This infrastructure must provide real-time updates, leveraging on-chain data rather than relying solely on periodic audits. Smart contract integration will facilitate real-time updates.

The integration of path payments enables efficient conversion routes for the CRC stablecoin. However, this requires careful monitoring of slippage across different paths and implementation of strictness parameters for price protection. Regular audits and real-time reporting of collateral reserves, accessible through a public dashboard, help maintain user trust in the stablecoin.

To keep the reserve safe, use secure methods like insured accounts or multi-signature wallets. Also, use decentralized systems to ensure access even during unstable times.
The entire management system must be supported by robust error handling, transaction monitoring, and status callback systems to ensure seamless operation and user experience.

## User flow:
This is a demonstration of how the stablecoin will work in real-time: 

**Minting:**
- User deposits CRC into a reserve account (via a bank or directly through a selected platform).
- Smart contract mints stablecoins and sends them to the user.
- Reserve balance updates to reflect the deposited CRC.

**Redemption:**
- User burns stablecoins through the selected platform.
- Smart contract releases equivalent CRC from the reserve to the user.
Reserve balance updates accordingly.

# Use cases:
**1. Financial Inclusion:**
As at 2017, about [30% of Costa Ricans](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2020/10/boosting-access-to-credit-and-ensuring-financial-inclusion-for-all-in-costa-rica_01330ee5/86037778-en.pdf) above 15 lacked access to banking services, especially in rural areas. A CRC-backed stablecoin can provide digital financial access, reducing barriers and enabling microtransactions.

**2. Cheaper Remittances:**
Costa Rica receives over $500M in international transfers annually. In 2023, this figure stood a [$588.9M](https://tradingeconomics.com/costa-rica/remittances). With fees averaging [5.8%](https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/peoplemove/remittances-latin-america-still-growing) in Latin America countries reducing the amount received. A stablecoin could lower fees to 0.5-1%, saving families around a significant sum.

**3. Economic Volatility Hedge:**
From June 2022 to April 2024, the colón strengthened by over [25%](https://www.fdiintelligence.com/content/news/has-costa-ricas-supercycle-reached-a-tipping-point-83862). While this appreciation indicates economic strength, it can pose challenges for exporters and those holding assets in foreign currencies. A CRC-backed stablecoin could provide a stable store of value, helping individuals and businesses manage fluctuations.

**4. Better Tourism Payments:**
Costa Rica welcomes [3.2M](https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:EU:5c830469-1273-4dc6-bfdf-de009c25fa36) tourists annually, who contribute about 13.4% of the country's GDP. There have been reports of tourists complaining of long transaction times ranging from 15-20 minutes. A CRC-backed stablecoin could reduce transaction times to just 3-5 seconds, enhancing tourists' experience and simplifying currency exchange.

**5. Small Business International Trade:**
Many Costa Rican businesses struggle with international payment complexity, with current cross-border transactions capped at [2.5% in fees](https://laweconcenter.org/resources/the-consequences-of-caps-on-cross-border-payment-fees-in-costa-rica/), which might make foreign issuers reject payment to Costa Rican businesses. A CRC-backed stablecoin could reduce costs to 0.5-1% and increase SME competitiveness.

**6. More Access to Capital:**
Small businesses in Costa Rica struggle to get loans from traditional banks. A stablecoin could provide alternative financing options, such as microloans and crowdfunding, to help underserved entrepreneurs access capital.

# Risks and Challenges:
The stablecoin's main risk is keeping its value stable during economic turmoil. Costa Rica's history of hyperinflation and currency devaluation makes this a huge concern.

Other significant risks include: 

**1. Financial Risks:**
The stablecoin faces several financial risks. Currency volatility is a major concern, as the Colón's value can fluctuate against the US dollar. Poor reserve management and devaluation of the Colón are also potential threats. If there's not enough CRC liquidity, users may struggle to convert their stablecoins to CRC.

**2. Technical Risks:**
Smart contract vulnerabilities and cybersecurity threats, which are both very unpredictable, could destabilize the coin significantly. Network infrastructure failures and oracle manipulation are also important technical issues that could affect the stablecoin.

**3. Regulatory Risks:**
Costa Rica has an uncertain legal framework around crypto. Compliance complications. Potential government intervention. Cross-border regulatory challenges all pose serious risks from the regulatory angle.

**4. Economic Risks:**
The stablecoin faces challenges from limited adoption of cryptocurrencies, and market confidence.

**5. Operational Risks:**
Several operational vulnerabilities exist, such as a lack of transparency, ineffective price stabilization mechanisms and limited technical expertise, which can hinder the stablecoin's development and maintenance.

**6. Foreign Exchange Risk:**
If the issuer holds CRC through a foreign exchange system, currency controls or unfavorable FX rates could erode its ability to maintain the peg.

**7. Risk of Bank Run:**
If users lose confidence in the stablecoin, a "run on the bank" could occur where everyone tries to redeem their tokens at once, straining reserves.

**8. Risk of Irrelevance:**
If the stablecoin can't scale, it may fail. Without enough liquidity, or if the reserve system becomes overwhelmed, users will lose trust. They willl doubt the stablecoin's ability to maintain its value, making it less useful.

## Government Clampdown Risks

If the Costa Rican government restricts or bans cryptocurrencies, the stablecoin may face:

- Usage Restrictions: Businesses and individuals may no longer be allowed to use the stablecoin, leading to reduced adoption and decreased liquidity.
- Banking Restrictions: Banks may be prohibited from supporting crypto-related activities, hindering stablecoin-to-fiat conversions and vice versa.
- Intervention Risk: In times of economic instability, governments may impose capital controls, and bans on alternative currencies (including stablecoins).

# Adoption barriers
**1. Limited Awareness and Education:**
Many people in [Latin America](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2024-global-crypto-adoption-index/), including Costa Rica, do not understand stablecoins, blockchain technology, or the benefits they bring. Lack of awareness leads to skepticism and slow adoption, particularly among the unbanked or underbanked population.

**2. Lack of Trust in Digital Currencies:**
Skepticism due to negative perceptions of cryptocurrency (e.g., association with [crime](https://ticotimes.net/2024/06/27/costa-rica-busts-major-cryptocurrency-laundering-ring) or volatility). Users and businesses may hesitate to adopt the stablecoin, fearing instability or scams.

**3. Regulatory Uncertainty:**
Costa Rica's laws around stablecoins and digital assets are unclear, creating uncertainty about taxes, anti-money laundering rules, and financial regulations. This ambiguity may scare businesses and individuals away, fearing they might not comply or face changing regulations.

**4. Competition from Existing Systems:** 
Existing payment systems (e.g., SINPE, credit/debit cards, and cash) are well-established and widely used. Users may see no need to switch to a stablecoin unless it offers clear, tangible benefits.

**5. Lack of Infrastructure:**
[Insufficient acceptance points](https://menafn.com/1109091775/The-Case-For-Cryptocurrency-Adoption-In-Costa-Rican-Businesses-A-Path-To-Financial-Inclusivity-And-Growth) for stablecoins in local stores, online platforms, and financial institutions. Limited use cases could discourage adoption, as users need practical ways to spend and redeem the stablecoin.

**7. Technological Barriers:**
Poor internet connectivity in rural areas may hinder a significant portion of the unbanked population from adopting stablecoin.

**8. Market Confidence Issues:** 
The stablecoin may struggle to gain traction, leading to low liquidity and limited use. In Costa Rica, cash is a hard habit to break, especially in rural areas and for small purchases.

**9. Cross-Border Integration Challenges:** 
While stablecoins can reduce remittance costs, adoption depends on collaboration with international partners. Without wide global support, cross-border use may remain limited.

# Regulatory Compliance:
To ensure regulatory compliance and market stability, the following measures should be implemented:

- Stellar's native clawback functionality is leveraged for fraud cases and regulatory compliance.
- Dedicated market makers implement spread management strategies and maintain adequate liquidity pools.
- Stellar's passive offers features to maintain tight spreads, and circuit breakers for high volatility.

## Compliance:
The issuer must adhere to:

- Costa Rican laws: [Anti-Money Laundering (Ley 8204](https://pgrweb.go.cr/scij/Busqueda/Normativa/Normas/nrm_texto_completo.aspx?nValor1=1&nValor2=48392&nValor3=91617&param1=NRTC&strTipM=TC&), Financial Supervision Law, Local Tax Code, and Digital Assets Framework.
- International standards: FATF Recommendations, Global KYC/AML Guidelines, and [Basel Committee Standards](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d383.pdf).
- Financial institutions: Work with institutions that follow [SUGEF regulations](https://www.sugef.fi.cr/normativa/normativa_vigente.aspx) or the Central Bank for the exchange of CRC to stablecoin and vice versa, ensuring proper audit trails and reserve management.

## Taxation:
- Businesses using stablecoins may face [capital gains taxes](https://globaltaxnews.ey.com/news/2023-1492-costa-rican-tax-authority-issues-a-private-letter-ruling-related-to-the-tax-treatment-of-crypto-assets) or VAT.
- Tax [classification of the stablecoin](https://multilaw.com/Multilaw/ZENTSO/BusinessGuides/Presentation/Section_Home.aspx?GuideCountry=Costa+Rica&GuideId=2&GuideSection=281) (currency, asset, or security) will determine tax obligations.
- Businesses and exchanges must track and report stablecoin transactions, ensuring accounting systems can handle digital assets.

# KYC/AML Requirements
To comply with Costa Rican and international regulations, the stablecoin must implement Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures. This involves:

- Collecting user information
- Validating identities
- Reporting suspicious activity

# zkKYC (Zero-Knowledge Know Your Customer)
zkKYC uses zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to verify user identities without [revealing sensitive data](https://zkpass.gitbook.io/zkpass/overview/use-cases/zkkyc). 

This method:

- Confirms KYC requirements without exposing user details
- Allows for compliance with regulations while maintaining user privacy
- Verifies humanity (e.g., using biometric checks) to prevent bot activity

**Benefits of zkKYC:**
- Increased user privacy
- Reduced fraud
- Regulatory compliance with Costa Rica's privacy and financial regulations
- Scalability while maintaining privacy and identity protection

**Integration with zk Firma Digital:**
In Costa Rica, integrating zkKYC with zk Firma Digital (a digital signature system) can:
- Enhance [security and authentication](https://docs.sakundi.io/docs/user-section/what-is-zk-firma-digital/) for digital transactions
- Ensure compliance with digital signature regulations
- Provide seamless verification of digital signatures
